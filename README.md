## Music Player Enten
A simple console-based music player written in Java. It allows users to play, pause, skip, and manage playlists.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/music-player.git
  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
  cd music-player
```
3. Compile and run:
```
javac MusicPlayer.java
java MusicPlayer
```

## Features
- Play and pause songs
- Skip to next/previous track
- Save and load playlists (by genres)
- Simple console interface

## Notes
This is a learning project while I practice Java.
The idea is to put your files into the music folder. Using jvszoom, it converts .mp3 files to .wav files and deletes the .mp3 files. Then, with the Clip package, it plays the songs.

## Future Improvements
- Add more playback controls (e.g., volume, shuffle, repeat)
- Integrate an API for searching and fetching tracks
- Support user-defined playlists
